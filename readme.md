## Details for teaching team
The website is responsive. I converted/included the password generator from project 2.
I also created an image generator that can resize an uploaded image. As part of the 
image generator, I created a cache that clears out expired images so that images remain
on the server only for a short time.

I created a custom validator that I use for all of the controllers to validate the data.
If there is invalid data, it is usually auto-corrected to the default value and processed normally.

As part of the user generator, I added the ability to export the data in JSON format. This is 
useful for using the user content in a variety of programming languages.
